# rock_paper_scissors

🗓️ Date: October 24, 2025

This project is the third project in The Odin Project curriculum. It serves as a practical exercise to apply the concepts and skills I’ve learned so far.

At this stage, the project runs entirely in the console, as I haven’t yet covered DOM manipulation. Once I complete the DOM manipulation lessons, I plan to revisit and rebuild this project with a fully interactive user interface to enhance its functionality and presentation.

The purpose of this project is to:
        Reinforce my understanding of core JavaScript concepts
        Practice problem-solving and logical thinking through coding
